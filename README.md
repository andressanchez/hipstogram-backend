**[Hipstogram][1]** is a project to analyze the habits of people when they are listening to music. Thus, we are able to answer questions such as: Why do people like this song? Which parts of this song do people like the most? What sort of people like this artist? All these questions will help us to understand people and their behaviors.

As an ambitious but realistic goal, it is composed of different subprojects: a Google Chrome extension, a backend, a set of Storm topologies and a frontend.  At this moment, **Hipstogram** is still in its early stages. Use it under your own risk and feel free to send us as many feedback as you want.
